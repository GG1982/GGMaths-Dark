                <p>I tailor my style of teaching to each student and their goals.</p>

                <p>For <span class="fancy-text">11+ students</span>, I use games and rewards to facilitate a comfortable and fun environment. In turn, this allows us to focus on the repetition of exercises to build our speed and strength in problem-solving.</p>

                <p>For <span class="fancy-text">GCSE students</span>, understanding the core topics, such as algebra, ratios, and numbers, is most important. These serve as our bedrock before we progress to more advanced concepts.</p>

                <p>For <span class="fancy-text">A-Level students</span>, I teach the entire syllabus as quickly as possible, leaving plenty of time for exam practice. I am proud that no student at this level has ever achieved less than a B, with the majority at A*/A.</p>

            </h2>
            <div class="about-container fade-in">
                <div class="about-body">
                    <p class="font-0">My love for it began while studying maths at The University of East Anglia. While there, I worked with a charity to help children from underprivileged backgrounds improve in their maths and English.</p>

                    <p class="font-0">Watching the growth and progress these children made was incredible and inspired me to pursue this as my job.</p>

                    <p class="font-0">I knew if I wanted to make the most impact on a student, it would be in a one-to-one setting. That's because I can change my style to fit the student's needs.</p>

                    <p class="font-0">And so, for the last 7 years, I have done that. During this time, I've helped students go from grade 3 to grade 7 in their GCSEs.</p>

                    <p class="font-0">I have worked alongside local primary schools, such as Ashmole Primary and Osidge School, teaching small groups of children. </p>
                    
                    <p class="font-0">I have helped A-Level students with their STEP and MAT entrance exams to Oxford or Cambridge. And I've helped students at 11+ get into grammar schools.</p>

                    <p class="font-0">I'm extraordinarily proud of each of my students and go to the best of my ability to give them the support they're seeking.</p>

                    <p class="font-0">Please <a href="#contact" class="body-link">send a message here</a> for more infomation.</p>

                    <p class="font-0">Problems from an Olympiad extend beyond the standard curriculum. These are problems that create a deeper understanding and a more capable student. </p>

For the past few years Giuliano has been working with me weekly and helped me understand maths and achieve what I didn't know I was capable of. I just got back my GCSEs and finished with a <span class="fancy-text">level 7 (an A)</span> and I really wouldn't have been able to do it without all his help. Not only is he a brilliant tutor but also kind and amazing individual, caring about his students in a way many other tutors lack. I thank him for being so patient with me and helping me exceed this subject.</p>

                    <p>Giuliano is an excellent Maths tutor, with a really friendly, approachable manner. He was just what our son needed when he was struggling to prepare for his GCSE. He has just achieved a <span class="fancy-text">grade 7</span> which is far higher than he could have hoped for without Giuliano's help. We would have no hesitation in highly recommending Giuliano.</p>
